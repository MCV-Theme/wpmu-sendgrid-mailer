SendGrid for WordPress Multisite

## Description

Email delivery simplified for WordPress Multisite. Requires PHP 5.3.

`Additional Plugin (optional): https://github.com/MCV-Theme/github-updater (used for updates)`

## Installation

### Manual

Check out the Codex for more information about [installing plugins manually](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

1. Download the latest [tagged archive](https://github.com/MCV-Theme/wpmu-sendgrid-mailer/releases) (choose the "zip" option).
2. Unzip the archive.
3. Fix the folder name to remove the extra stuff GitHub adds, like _-master_. Rename to **wpmu-sendgrid-mailer**.
4. Copy the folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
5. Go to the Plugins screen and click __Activate__.

## Issues

Please log issues on the GitHub at https://github.com/MCV-Theme/wpmu-sendgrid-mailer/issues

If you are using a WordPress Multisite installation, the plugin **should** be network activated.
